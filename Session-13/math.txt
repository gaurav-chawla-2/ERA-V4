Theorem: The square root of 2 is irrational.
Proof: Suppose sqrt(2) is rational. Then sqrt(2) = p/q for coprime integers p and q.
2 = p^2 / q^2 => 2q^2 = p^2.
This implies p^2 is even, so p is even. Let p = 2k.
2q^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 => q^2 = 2k^2.
This implies q^2 is even, so q is even.
But if p and q are both even, they are not coprime, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, sqrt(2) is irrational.

Let f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1. Find the derivative f'(x).
Using the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1).
f'(x) = 2x^(2-1) + 2(1)x^(1-1) + 0
f'(x) = 2x + 2.

Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 14.
3x = 14 - 5
3x = 9
x = 3.

The area of a circle is given by A = pi * r^2.
If the radius r is 5, then A = 25 * pi.
